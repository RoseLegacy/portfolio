            <p>My education is fairly basic, I went to Tualatin High School and took some college before coming to Epicodus. I was in the work force for about a year in between working for a Safeway in Oregon city. During this time I began transitioning from a male to a female so my life changed quite a bit and I decided I wanted to do something other than work in retail all my life. I have a small amout of experience programming just from a few projects in high school and college but I am a quick learner so I hoped that I would fit in well at Epicodus. Overall my life has been fairly straight forward and easy even though I am part of a minority, I am very thankful for the opportunities that I've been given and don't want to waste any of them.</p>
            <p>Some of my hobbies include; photography, exploration, driving, and playing games. Every once in awhile I'll go for a long drive with a friend and usually end up driving for hours or going hundreds of miles. Getting away from what I know has been one of my favorite things for a very long time, wanderlust has been ingrained in who I am for as long as I can remember.</p>
